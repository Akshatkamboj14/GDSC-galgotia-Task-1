I am Akshat Kamboj, currently pursuing computer science engineering with specialization in (AIML). since my childhood, I was fascinated with computers and technology. I have done a python certification course from Udemy (Python For Beginners) and I am currently learning Java tutorials from youtube. My strengths are I am a fast learner and I am focused and stretchable. My weaknesses are sometimes I felt impatient and take things personally. I am interested in android development so after my bachelor's I want to be an android developer. Google and Android have changed the concept of communication globally and not only the technology but affordably is one of the important achievements of google and their operating system. it is user-friendly and into the reaches of common people which affects me a lot.
